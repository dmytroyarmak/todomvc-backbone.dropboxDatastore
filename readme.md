# Backbone.js with [dropboxDatastore](https://github.com/dmytroyarmak/Backbone.dropboxDatastore) TodoMVC Example

> Backbone.js gives structure to web applications by providing models with key-value binding and custom events, collections with a rich API of enumerable functions, views with declarative event handling, and connects it all to your existing API over a RESTful JSON interface.
